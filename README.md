# Playwright fixture fail

This is an example of how I thought fixtures were supposed to be used but then found out I was very wrong.

My assumption is that by using the login page in every fixture, my tests were not actually isolated.

I was planning on converting to storage state anyway.

To run:

```
npm i
npm start
npm run e2e
```
